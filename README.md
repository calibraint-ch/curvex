# CurvX

CurvX is an application that allows users to create, customize, and manage their own tokens with ease. With CurvX, users can participate in token pools created by other users, which helps maintain liquidity and promotes the growth of various token markets. The platform offers the flexibility for users to choose the bonding curve type that best aligns with their desired tokenomics and project requirements. Additionally, users have the potential to sell their tokens at a higher price after the lock-up period, enabling them to realize profits.

## Features

- Create and customize tokens: Users can easily create and customize their own tokens according to their specific needs and preferences.
- Token pool participation: Users can take part in existing token pools created by other users on the platform, fostering liquidity and supporting the growth of token markets.
- Flexible bonding curve selection: CurvX allows users to choose from different types of bonding curves to tailor the token economics to their project requirements.
- Profit potential: By participating in token pools and leveraging the lock-up period, users have the opportunity to sell their tokens at a higher price and potentially make a profit.

## How We Built It

CurvX was developed using a combination of technologies and frameworks. The main components of the application were built using ReactJS, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface. The smart contracts, which manage the different bonding curve types, were written in Solidity from scratch. We deployed and tested these contracts on the Fantom Testnet and Mainnet using the Hardhat development environment.

## Repository

The CurvX repository consists of the following components:

- **CurvX Contracts**: This directory contains the Solidity smart contracts used in the CurvX application. You can find the contracts at [github.com/calibraint-ch/curvx/tree/develop/smart-contracts](https://github.com/calibraint-ch/curvx/tree/develop/smart-contracts).
